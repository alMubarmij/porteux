PorteuX can be installed to any media storage (including USB flash drive)
without requiring your personal data to be erased. Partitions supported:
ext2, ext3, ext4, FAT, exFAT, NTFS and XFS.

The simplest way to do that is copying the ISO content to your media
storage and running the installer, which will just make the media
bootable (instructions below), not touching or removing your existing data.

It's not recommended to use any third-party ISO installer application,
such as Rufus or Etcher because the media storage will be set to
read-only mode, making it impossible to write any data, including
automatic save changes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| EFI System: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Make sure the first partition is of type FAT32.
2) Copy /boot and /EFI folders onto the FAT32 partition.
3) The second partition can be any of the supported ones and it will
contain /porteux folder.

| Legacy System: |

1) Copy /boot, /EFI and /porteux folders onto the desired partition.

| From Windows: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Navigate into the /boot folder that you have just copied.
2) Run 'porteux-installer-for-windows.exe' and follow the instructions. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| From Linux: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Navigate into the /boot folder that you have just copied.
2) From the terminal, run 'porteux-installer-for-linux.run' and follow
the instructions.

| Conclusion: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After running the installation program, you should be able to boot 
PorteuX from your media storage. Reboot your computer, and make sure 
that your BIOS is set to boot from the media storage where PorteuX is.

| Notes: |
~~~~~~~~~~

1) If your media storage is formatted with a Linux filesystem
(e.g. EXT4 or XFS), before the first boot make sure the folder
/porteux has guest ownership otherwise changes will not be
automatically saved.

2) If your media storage is formatted with a Windows filesystem
(e.g. FAT or NTFS), the changes you make to your system will not be 
automatically saved. In this case, you can create a '.dat' file
container using PorteuX Save Session application after the boot.
